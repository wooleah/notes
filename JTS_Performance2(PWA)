PWA(Google's idea) -> Apple doesn't like it that much(slow on implementing this idea)
- runs on all platforms
- has icons, faster(mobile in mind)
- works offline
- you can add it to the home screen
*check https://whatwebcando.today/
Real use cases:
1. twitter made this as well and moved all their mobile traffic to PWA(create-react-app)
2. Uber and Lyft
3. pokedex.org -> for studying
4. https://hnpwa.com/ -> hackernews pwa page
*You can check App Manifest in Application tab


What is the value of this tech?
- Enhances UX

Create-react-app has this setup out of the box

**Lighthouse by Google** (already implemented in chrome dev-tool Audits tab)
- chrome extension that tells us how close our app is to the PWA
- used as an indicator

- Things you need to know before making a PWA
A. HTTPS(PWA requires HTTPS for security reasons)
- Google is really pushing it
*use letsencrypt.org to get free certificate or cloudflare
- also github pages automatically implement this

B. app manifest
- create-react-app generates this for you out of the box
- simple JSON file that explains how that app should look on the home screen and such
*html head meta="viewport" really helps with different screen sizes, and optimized it, so it's a MUST
https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/has-viewport-meta-tag
- you can make favicon with realfavicongenerator.net, and also customize and preview splash screen for our manifest file

C. Service worker(it's a script that your browser runs on the background)
- separate from the web-page web-app(used for features that doesn't need a webpage or UI)
- think of it as another worker thread(programmable proxy): allows us to customize what happens on each request(this is why PWA works offline)
- push notification also works with this(still on the work)
- in create-react-app this is serviceWorker.js (check with https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)
- when serviceWorker is activated and registered, it's either going to be terminated or run on background to fetch messages

Why do we need this?
- Without the serviceWorker website simply requests files to the server and gets it
- But with the serviceWorker(network proxy), website talks to SW first
1. it intercepts the request made to the network
2. checks if it really needs that request(Web api: Cache api) - Cache Storage in Application tab(chrome dev-tool)
3. if not, we talk to the network and get those files

What if we didn't have creat-react-app
- with library(sw-precache) build react app with --config=sw-precache-config.js
- and in index.html, we do
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');
  });
}
- add the manifest file
- set sw-precache-config.js

How do we create PWA?
1. deploy it on the web (using gh-pages package)
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#step-2-install-gh-pages-and-add-deploy-to-scripts-in-packagejson
2. change serviceWorker.unregister to register
3. audit and improve low scores
