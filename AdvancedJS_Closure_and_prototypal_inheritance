When you add param in a function, it adds that variable in var env as if we declared it.

HOF - why is it useful?
- Higher Order Function is a func that returns a func or accepts a func as a parameter
1. we can give it the data
2. tell the func what to do when we invoke it
** ability to tell the func what to do during invocation

- HOF use the concepts of currying and currying use the concept of closure

Why is invoking a function directly inside our main function a bad idea?
- it created below side-effects
1. tight coupling between the two func(main func becomes impure)
2. part of main func has external dependency and it can be modified by other parts of your code, that creates side-effect
3. main func becomes less testable and more error-prone

example) creating multiplyBy func
// should return a func that accepts a num and multiply it by something it wants
const multiplyBy = (num1) => {
  return num2 => num1 * num2;
}
// I want a func that receives a number and multiply it with 2
const multiplyTwo = multiplyBy(2);
const multiplyByTen = multiplyBy(10);
console.log(multiplyTwo(4))
console.log(multiplyByTen(2))

or 

// each step shows you how you call the func
const multiplyBy = num1 => num2 => num1 * num2
console.log(multiplyBy(2)(5))
