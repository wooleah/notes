JS has v8 engine - has two parts(Memory Heap, Call Stack)
1. Memory Heap - memory is allocated here
 - Memory Leak: there's a limited amount of memory, so if you make too many vars(that we don't use), then there will be unused memory all around the place -> That's why global var is bad!
2. Call Stack - where code is read & executed(LIFO)

Questions
1. JS is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking?
 - single threaded -> one call stack only(only can do one thing at a time)
  -> pros: can avoid complicated scenarios that can happen in multi-threaded languages(deadlocks)
 - What if one item in call stack is a massive task?(takes really long time) -> then on a website user won't be able to do anything(other tasks are blocked from performing) -> ASYNC to the rescue! -> wrap that massive task in setTimeout and make it async
 -> In order to not block the thread, a task can be transformed to async
2. Stack overflow is when call stack gets too big and there's no more space in call stack

JS Run-Time Environment
On top of the engine, they have Web APIs(DOM-document, AJAX-XMLHttpRequest, Timeout-setTimeout), Callback Queue, and Event Loop

ex)
1) console.log(1);
2) setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 2000);
3) console.log(3);
-> 1 and 3 runs first, and after 2s when timer is done, Web API will give you a notice and say there's a callback, and callback of setTimeout will be added to the Callback Queue
-> Event Loop constantly checks if the Call stack is empty, and if it's empty then it checks the Callback Queue. It sees callback from setTimeout and moves it to the Call Stack


Section 2: JavaScript Foundation

Brief history
- American engineer Brendan Eich, creator of JS made the first js engine spidermonkey(Firefox uses this).
In 2008, google made v8 with c++ to achieve better speed with their newly created Chrome browser and Google map

Standard(ECMAscript)
- tells engine creators how js should work and how it should be standardized

What is JS Engine?
- Allows cpu to understand JS and give commands to computer
- Composed of Parser(parse string), AST(abstract syntax tree)
- then Interpreter -> Profiler -> Compiler -> Optimized code
- or Interpreter -> Bytecode

Interpreter vs compiler(two ways to run js)
- Interpreter translates code line by line on the fly
- Compiler doesn't translate on the fly, it reads through the code then try to understand what it is. Then it'll change that code into a new language that does the same thing.
*All languagues will have to go through interpreter or compiler at one point
- Interpreter and Compiler are both compilers but Interpreter read code line by line on the fly(compiles code at runtime dynamically). And compiler does the translation before the code gets executed. So basically they both translate code into bytecode(actually all js engines will produce bytecode). They both will eventually compile the source code down to machine code.

Babel + Typescript
- Babel is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).
- Typescript is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript.
