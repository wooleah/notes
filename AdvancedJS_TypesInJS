Two types of languages: static and dynamically typed languages
- js is dynamic and weakly typed language(when js sees 'aaah' + 18, it thinks we want to add 18 to 'aaah' as a string so it coerces it's type and adds it(weakly typed). strongly typed language just throws error when they run this code(python).
- also when you don't have to add type like js or python when we declar something then it's dynamically typed language

primitive types in js are immutable
- number, Boolean, undefined, null, string, Symbol
- when you change it you create a new space in memory(new value) and replace prev variable
- primitive value are passed by value(values are copied and stored in memory)

reference types are passed by reference
- Object, functions, array
- it passes a pointer that points to somewhere in memory heap(we don't pass the copied value directly)

copying the object
- simply assigning and spreading object doesn't deep-copy the object(nested object)
- you have to stringify -> parse it to fully deep copy the object
