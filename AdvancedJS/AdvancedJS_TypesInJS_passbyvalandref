Two types of languages: static and dynamically typed languages
- js is dynamic and weakly typed language(when js sees 'aaah' + 18, it thinks we want to add 18 to 'aaah' as a string so it coerces it's type and adds it(weakly typed). strongly typed language just throws error when they run this code(python).
- also when you don't have to add type like js or python when we declar something then it's dynamically typed language

primitive types in js are immutable
- number, Boolean, undefined, null, string, Symbol
- when you change it you create a new space in memory(new value) and replace prev variable
- primitive value are passed by value(values are copied and stored in memory)

reference types are passed by reference
- Object, functions, array
- it passes a pointer that points to somewhere in memory heap(we don't pass the copied value directly)
- with passing by ref we can save space in memory(we're not copying the obj and creating multiple version it's just in one location and we pass the pointer)


copying the object
- simply assigning and spreading object doesn't deep-copy the object(nested object)
- you have to stringify -> parse it to fully deep copy the object
