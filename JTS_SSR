Why are we considering SSR now?
-> Websites in the past
- request made to the server, and server returns fully rendered html page
-> SPA got popular
- websites has one html file, rest is done with js(navigating between links)
-> 2 major issues
1. more js is sent to the client on the initial request(takes longer to get sent and execute) - slower to load
2. SEO optimization
