1. Traditional
- html, js, css from server -> client
- differs by browsers, we need to change js to work with all of the different browsers
2. jQuery
- devs don't have to think about the dom and ignore browser differences and just focus on jQuery syntax
- devs now make larger websited(uh oh) -> backbone.js came out(organize files)
3. Concept of SPA
- only load html once(stay on the same page)
- js changes dom to display new things
4. AngularJS(2010) by google
- wraps your project and organizes it
- MVC is clearer
- things get complex and it's now harder to find bugs, and facebook devs came up with their solution
5. ReactJS(2013) by facebook
- really took off
- AngularJS decided to rewrite the whole lib -> changes it's name to Angular (people moves to React)
