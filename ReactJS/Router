1. install and import
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
2. Wrap your <App /> with <Router> in index.js
-> Now router functionality is available in your App component
3. Use Route Now
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
    </div>
  );
}
-> without exact all path including / will match HomePage (ex. /hats)
