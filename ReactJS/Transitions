use npm i react-transition-group
- this adds and removes classes depending on the state -> you have to make the animation

How animation works with this lib

1. it adds enter class
2. it forces reflow then add enter-active(gets added on the next tick)
3. adds exit after timeout
4. does the same with enter but it's exit this time
*active is the style you want to animate to, that's why transition is only added here

.menu-primary-enter {
  position: absolute;
  transform: translateX(-110%);
}
.menu-primary-enter-active {
  transform: translateX(0%);
  transition: all $speed ease;
}
.menu-primary-exit {
  position: absolute;
}
.menu-primary-exit-active {
  transform: translateX(-110%);
  transition: all $speed ease;
}
