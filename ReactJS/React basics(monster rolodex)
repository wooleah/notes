1. Class component
- we get access to the state
- You are not allowed to modify state

we need key when rendering a list
why? react needs to know what element changed
-> react recognizes this and only re-render changes element

by extending React.Component we get functionalities React provide us and use it


2. Folder structure
- very important when the project gets bigger
- file name can be explicit (card.component.jsx instead of card.js)
**How to stay organized

3. Functional component
- props passed to this component has children property
- does one thing well

4. Think about which component will need which state before you architect
