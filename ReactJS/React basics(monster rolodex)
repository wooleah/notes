1. Class component
- we get access to the state
- You are not allowed to modify state

we need key when rendering a list
why? react needs to know what element changed
-> react recognizes this and only re-render changes element

by extending React.Component we get functionalities React provide us and use it

- weird things
Even though the super call knows which props to expect, we need to be explicit with our constructor function:

export class Sample extends Component<SampleProps> {
  constructor(props: SampleProps) {
    super(props)
  }
}

- Due to setState being async, if you want to update state using previous state, you need to use callback(prevState, prevProps)
- And if you want to use that updated value after the state updates, you want to use the second callback provided to setState
ex. handleClick = () => {
  this.setState((prevState, prevProps) => {
    return { meaningOfLife: prevState.meaningOfLife + 1 }
  },
    () => console.log(this.state.meaningOfLife);
  )
}


2. Folder structure
- very important when the project gets bigger
- file name can be explicit (card.component.jsx instead of card.js)
**How to stay organized

3. Functional component
- props passed to this component has children property
- does one thing well

4. Some important things to keep in mind
** Think about which component will need which state before you architect!!
** Decide on Components, Decide the state and where it lives, Think about what changes when state changes
- when we borrow methods from React(componentDidMount, render, etc.), React sets this keyword for us, but when we're writing them we have to be careful
