Managing state in one big object is what redux does

Why redux?
- good for Managing large state
- useful for sharing data between components
- predictable state management using 3 principles

3 principles
- Single source of truth
- State is read-only (boost immutability)
- Changes using pure functions (same input results with same output)

redux flow
1. action(user invokes some action)
2. reducer(pure function) - gets an input and create an output
3. store - gets updated
4. DOM changes from state changes
* this derived from flux pattern(one way data flow of action -> dispatcher -> store -> view)

Key point
- redux pretty much is this.state but much bigger
- redux allows react state to be more scalable
- think of it as global state(you can keep only ui related local state in components)
