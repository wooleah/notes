To use state in functional component, you can use react hooks

1. useState
- import it with {useState} from 'react'
this returns two values when called, you can destructure it with array
const [open, setOpen] = useState(defaulVal) for example
- set defaultVal to set default value for open -> open is the state and setOpen is setter that sets the state
