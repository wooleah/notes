1. Platonic shapes
- svg is looking at a piece of graph paper that can grow infinitely in all directions
- shapes can be drawn even outside of your view using viewBox

2. Viewbox
- viewBox="0 0 100 100" (x, y, width, height)
- if you keep the viewbox and change the width of the svg, then shapes in that svg gets smaller(smaller size of graph paper)

3. preserve aspect ratio
- you won't need this most of the times, you need it when you need some advanced cropping techniques
- preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
- x and Y takes Min/Mid/Max and you can choose between meet & slice
- meet -> constrain in the viewBox, no shape is going to be cut off(so if you do xMidYMid, it stays in the center)
- slice -> it expands so the corners meet the edge of the screen, and it'll cut the shape
-> this takes all the constraints out of the shape and might stretch it
-> you can use it for the layout(preserveAspectRatio="none")

4. grouping(it's like a div)

5. drawing paths
- path start with M and closes with Z
- L is lineTo, H is horizontal line, and V is vertical line
- When you make MLHVZ lowercase, it becomes relative(whereever you're starting from, go a little bit down)
- when it's absolute, it goes exactly to that spot
- <polyline points="x,y x,y x,y" /> -> it's a squiggly line
