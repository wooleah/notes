1. Platonic shapes
- svg is looking at a piece of graph paper that can grow infinitely in all directions
- shapes can be drawn even outside of your view using viewBox
2. Viewbox
- viewBox="0 0 100 100" (x, y, width, height)
- if you keep the viewbox and change the width of the svg, then shapes in that svg gets smaller(smaller size of graph paper)
3. preserve aspect ratio
- you won't need this
4. grouping
5. drawing paths
6. svg on export
