Async - code that you can run later

ES9 2018
For await of
Loop through array of promises

for await (let req of promises) {
 const data = await req.json()
 console.log(data)
}

Finally keyword
Use it at the end of promise chain to run some code always

Parallel, sequential, race(do three things and run only the one that is done first)

parallel.then(console.log)
then passes param to the function inside
Promise.race already exists

-> Think about what's the most optimal solution for your async code 

Job queue (legacy browser might not have job queue in their js runtime)
Job queue was added in ES6 with Promises
Event loop already has callback queue(task queue)
So ecmascript committee made job queue(microtask queue) which has higher priority than callback queue meaning that event queue is going to start looking for job queue before checking callback queue 

settimeout is a facade func, it's not js it's part of web API that calls timer API


JS has power to do complex thing despite being single threaded because of it's async model
- but how to those web API get the computing power to run things on the background?(because it's single thread)
-> it's background thread hidden from us
browser has web workers(does background things), nodeJS has worker threads
- web worker is a js program running on a different thread in parallel to our main thread

example) new Worker('worker.js') -> you can save this as worker and post messages to another thread

fetch() -> facade func because underneath it it calls web API

concurrency(single core CPU)
- you can do different tasks in different thread but only one thread can run at a time
concurrency + parallelism(multi core CPU)
- you can do multiple things at the same time

JS is single threaded(has one call stack), but the beauty is in it's simplicity and restrictions
-> allows us to write simple clean code
