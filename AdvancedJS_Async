Async - code that you can run later

ES9 2018
For await of
Loop through array of promises

for await (let req of promises) {
 const data = await req.json()
 console.log(data)
}

Finally keyword
Use it at the end of promise chain to run some code always

Parallel, sequential, race(do three things and run only the one that is done first)

parallel.then(console.log)
then passes param to the function inside
Promise.race already exists

-> Think about what's the most optimal solution for your async code 

Job queue
Job queue was added in ES6 with Promises
Event loop already has callback queue(task queue)
So ecmascript committee made job queue(microtask queue) which has higher priority than callback queue meaning that event queue is going to start looking for job queue before checking callback queue 

settimeout is a facade func, it's not js it's part of web API that calls timer API
