============== What is serverless ==============
It's a pre-configured nodejs server -> you don't have to stuff that you normally have to do such as:
load-balancing, networking, ..etc
drawback: what you can do is limited(nodejs version for example)

Two basic type of cloud functions
1. HTTP
- allow you to build RESTful endpoints(you get an url that you can call from client-side)
2. Background
- function that automatically gets fired when some event happens
- user signs up, some file is uploaded, something changes on analytics

-> This approach allows you to build more reactive infra with less code with less cost
- pay as you go(pay as much as you used)
- scale in linear way
- everything you do on your backend is isolated microservice, so you don't have to worry about affecting other logics when changing something
*Other popular approach is to write all of your code in monolith and deploy it to cloud as a docker container
- all your code is contained in a single code base and shared throughout that project
- to scale you deploy it with more docker container
