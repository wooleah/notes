============== What is serverless ==============
It's a pre-configured nodejs server -> you don't have to stuff that you normally have to do such as:
load-balancing, networking, ..etc
drawback: what you can do is limited(nodejs version for example)

Two basic type of cloud functions
1. HTTP
- allow you to build RESTful endpoints(you get an url that you can call from client-side)
2. Background
- function that automatically gets fired when some event happens
- user signs up, some file is uploaded, something changes on analytics

-> This approach allows you to build more reactive infra with less code with less cost
- pay as you go(pay as much as you used)
- scale in linear way
- everything you do on your backend is isolated microservice, so you don't have to worry about affecting other logics when changing something
*Other popular approach is to write all of your code in monolith and deploy it to cloud as a docker container
- all your code is contained in a single code base and shared throughout that project
- to scale you deploy it with more docker container


============== Project setup ==============
1. Typescript
2. npm i firebase-tools -g

*keep in mind that cloud function backend is completely isolated nodejs environment and is agnostic to what frontend framework you're using

3. firebase login
4. firebase init


============== Project structure ==============
Functions are little microservices that handle different task we need for the backend
- what we export from index.js will be deployed to cloud function's backend
- we can install our own node dependencies in cloud functions
 

============== Deployment ==============
firebase deploy --only functions -> deploy all the functions you exported in index.js
- logs are important as well
- your functions will also be deployed to GCP(your actual source-code can be viewed) + can send test requests


============== Intro to HTTP functions ==============
Cloud functions are based on expressJs
- these are invoked manually
- if there is a backend code you wanna run but there's no event that can trigger it, you can use this

firebase server --only functions
or npm run serve from /functions (better)

with functions.http.onRequest(req, res)
you can res.send to the client, and parse req.query, params
- in the real world you might use url params as an id for a doc from db and return that to the client

Sending errors to the client
- with response.status(400).send('error message')


============== ExpressJs for advanced routing ==============
install express in /functions dir
const app = express();
app.get()..
export const api = functions.http.onRequest(app);

then when you're done configuring routes -> do firebase serve
cloud function is hosted at localhost:5000
- when sending request from localhost to different origin you get an error -> CORS

Using middleware
app.use(cors({origin: true}))
by using express you can keep your code DRY and maintainable

study more expressjs to master this

============== Auth functions(background functions) ==============
List of events that trigger background functions
- cloud firestore triggers
- realtime database triggers
- firebase authentication triggers
- google analytics for firebase triggers
- crashlytics triggers
- cloud storage triggers
- cloud pub/sub triggers

*Every background function needs to return a promise

1. Auth function
- When new user signs up, run the function and store that user in the db

export const createUserRecord = functions.auth.user().onCreate((user, context) => {
  // context is a metadata that can be useful sometimes
});

defining database directly in the function is going to affect the performance

admin.firestore() to get db
and inside onCreate we get user and we can use that to get documentReference db.doc(`users/${user.uid}`)
then return userRef.set() -> write function that returns promise
*remember that onCreate needs to return a promise

Testing: npm run shell
firebase shell allows us to test function before deploying it
