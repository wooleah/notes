width and height sets the size of the canvas
- rect starts from top left corner and draws with width and height
- circle starts from the center and draws with the radius
- line draws a line between two different points

<path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" fill="yellow" stroke="salmon" stroke-width="1" />

For complex shapes you can make use of path
- you set the path in d
- M is the starting point(you Move your hand to that point)
- L is draw line to that point(you draw a Line to that point)
- Z is close path(hand goes back to the starting position)
- H is draw Horizontal line
- V is draw Vertical line
- C is draw Curve to that point(takes 6 points, starting point, end point of control stick, and end point of the curve - cubic bezier)
- S is draw Smooth curve to that point
