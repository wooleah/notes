SSR
- render page on the server and send it to the client so client sees the page(not interactive yet) before js are fully loaded

Basically the only difference between CSR and SSR(to user) is that SSRendered page looks like it loads a lot faster

Create react element from the server and send it to the client
- using renderToString from 'react-dom/server'
- and on the client side call ReabctDOM.hydrate(), then react will preserve server-side rendered markup and later attach event handlers(we need window object for this)
