Problem: Service got larger and managing all the servers and dbs are getting more and more difficult
Solution: make other people do it(+ take responsibilities)

AWS
- cloud infra as a service(rent)
- choose solutions you need and only pay for those
- on prem datacenter(server on your own machine) is becoming less common because of security and reliability, scaling

What can they provide?
- load balancers
- scaling when user grows
- push notification, badges
- and tons more

Competitors(They offer different services)
- Microsoft Azure
- GCP(Google cloud platform)
- IBM(not really in the market)

*This is the field of DevOps and most likely web devs won't work on this(because there are people dedicated to this field)
- but it's important to know how this works with web dev stack
