Because setting up env is annoying, people used virtualization techinique to take care of that
and docker container uses host OS(they don't have their own OS like virtual machines), it's a lot faster
- fast and easy access to run small apps(multiple of those to make monolithic app -> container orchestration: kubernetes)

How it works
Host: your laptop(machine that hosts your container)
Container: created with Docker on top of Host
Image: Inside the container, Docker uses this to bundle your application into a standalone package that can live inside of a container
- it's just a file that describes what container should do
- inside the image I can say I want node server, then Docker reads it and generates a container that runs node for us
- env inside the container is completely isolated
- also has a writable file system(extra functionality)
- Docker executes this image in container
