Because setting up env is annoying, people used virtualization techinique to take care of that
and docker container uses host OS(they don't have their own OS like virtual machines), it's a lot faster
- fast and easy access to run small apps(multiple of those to make monolithic app -> container orchestration: kubernetes)

How it works
Host: your laptop(machine that hosts your container)
Container: created with Docker on top of Host
Image: Inside the container, Docker uses this to bundle your application into a standalone package that can live inside of a container
- it's just a file that describes what container should do
- inside the image I can say I want node server, then Docker reads it and generates a container that runs node for us
- env inside the container is completely isolated
- also has a writable file system(extra functionality)
- Docker executes this image in container

Docker hub(it's like npm)
- community already created many images
- you would most likely use this instead of writing your own images

What we're going to do in JTS course
1. create Docker container that will connect to the frontend(smartbrain)
2. We'll have node express api in this container
3. implement postgres and redis(caching, session management)
4. with all of those setup in a single container we can easily access this app

How other companies are doing this
frontend - Load balancer(distributes clients to different api servers so we don't clog up one api server when there are tons of req)

Load balancer - API server1
              - API server2(clones)...
API server - Database, Redis, ...etc
