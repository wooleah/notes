without modules we have tight coupling problem where everything depends on each other
- we don't know what would affect which code

So how do we separate big chunk of code?
1. Adding them in html file won't do much because in the past it simply combined all added js files
-> same as putting all of those files in one page
- and dependencies are implicit(it's not written anywhere, you just have to figure it out)
- without modules, all global vars might clash

how do we handle big codebase while working with many devs? -> in JS we have ES6 modules now
What about before?
