Tree

1. Binary search tree
- can be O(n) if unbalanced
- other than that, it's O(log n) meaning that you don't traverse through the whole structure, you simply decide once on each level(depth)

**Divide and conquer : simply means that we don't look at every single node, instead we devide up and make decision on each node to go left or right
