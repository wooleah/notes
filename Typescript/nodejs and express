===== Things that I didn't know about =====
1. there is ts-node which is nodejs but ts(for production it might not be ideal, because it has the extra compilation step, so maybe just use it for dev)
2. node runs ts file as if it's js(it doesn't care about file extension)
3. on config file, set "moduleResolution": "node"
4. then need to install @types/node
5. we need to use import express from 'express'; to get type support

import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'; -> adds types
- now I can add types in express middleware properly
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(500).json({
    message: err.message
  });
});
