===== Things that I didn't know about =====
1. there is ts-node which is nodejs but ts(for production it might not be ideal, because it has the extra compilation step, so maybe just use it for dev)
2. node runs ts file as if it's js(it doesn't care about file extension)
3. on config file, set "moduleResolution": "node"
4. then need to install @types/node
5. we need to use import express from 'express'; to get type support

import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'; -> adds types
- now I can add types in express middleware properly
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(500).json({
    message: err.message
  });
});

6. make controllers for logic with same file name as routes
7. if you don't want to manually import req, res, next all the time, import RequestHandler from express instead
8. to parse the body of incoming request -> user body-parser(import json from it)
- json from body-parser(middleware) parses body and makes json data then populate body keyword in req
9. Use generic types to handle dynamic properties in req.params
export const updateTodo: RequestHandler<{ id: string }> = (req, res, next) => {
  const todoId = req.params.id;

  const upatedText = (req.body as {text: string}).text;
};
10. Add a generic error handling middleware
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(500).json({
    message: err.message
  });
});
