============ What we'll study ============
Intersection types
Type guards
Discriminated unions
Type casting
Function overloads


============ Intersection types ============
type Admin = {
  name: string;
  privileges: string[];
}

type Employee = {
  name: string;
  startDate: Date;
}

type ElevatedEmployee = Admin & Employee;
-> you can do this with interfaces as well
- or you can create third interface that extends both Admin and Employee interfaces
- When you create an instance of this ElevatedEmployee, you need to initialize name, privileges, and startDate

Intersection types are especially useful for object types
- becuse you can get the combination of those two types

type Combinable = string | number;
type Numeric = number | boolean;

type Universal = Combinable & Numeric;
-> Universal is number type
- you actually get the intersection in this case


============ Type guards.. ?? ============
1. checking with typeof and returning proper type(type casting) depending on the type received
if (typeof a === 'string' || typeof b === 'string') {
  return a.toString() + b.toString();
}
2. checking properties in the object
- if ('startDate' in object)
3. checking instance of a class
- you can also use if (propertyName in object)
- you can use if (instance instanceof className)
- however you can't do this with interface since they're not compiled to js

============ Discriminated Unions(Type guard pattern for objects) ============
- Have one common property in all object description included in union type
interface Bird {
  type: 'bird';
  flyingSpeed: number;
}
interface Horse {
  type: 'horse';
  runningSpeed: number;
}

type Animal = Bird | Horse;

function moveAnimal(animal: Animal) {
  let speed;
  switch (animal.type) {
    case 'bird': // you even get an autocomplete
      speed = animal.flyingSpeed;
      break;
    case 'horse':
      speed = animal.runningSpeed;
      break;
  }
  console.log(`Moving at ${speed}`);
  
============ Type casting ============
When tsc doesn't know something is a certain type, but we as a developer knows what that is.
typescript gets 1 but not 2
1. const userInputEl = document.querySelector('input'); // available because tsconfig lib has dom included
2. const userInputEl = document.querySelector('user-input');

You can do 
<HTMLInputElement>document.querySelector('user-input');
or
document.querySelector('user-input') as HTMLInputElement // I like this more
*Make sure you just use one for code consistency

when you use ! in typescript it means that the expression in front of it will NEVER yield null
document.querySelector('user-input')! // like this
-> type casting excludes null, so if you're not sure about that, do below

============ Index properties ============
interface ErrorContainer {
  id: string;
  [prop: string]: string; // propertyName: value
}
const emptyContainer: ErrorContainer = {};
const errorBag: ErrorContainer = {
  email: 'Not a valid email',
  1: 'hi' // number will change to string
};
- When you're not sure which propertyName you'll have yet
- you can't have any other type of propertyName
- you can only have string or number

============ Function overloads ============
*Very useful
function add(a: Combinable, b: Combinable) {
  if (typeof a === 'string' || typeof b === 'string') {
    return a.toString() + b.toString();
  }
  return a + b;
}
-> we know if we pass two numbers, it'll return number BUT
const result = add(1, 5);
-> typescript still thinks that this will return Combinable(string|number)
-> means that we can't use autocomplete function

- we can type cast it but it's not clean -> use function overload
function add(a: number, b: number): number // this won't get compiled but typescript will tell us what type it'll be
function add(a: Combinable, b: Combinable) {
  if (typeof a === 'string' || typeof b === 'string') {
    return a.toString() + b.toString();
  }
  return a + b;
}
- you can even make one paremeter optional


============ Optional chaining(easier undefined if check) ============
in JS when you use/log something that might not exist you do
-> fetchedUserData.job && fetchedUserData.job.title
but in typescript we have optional chaining
-> fetchedUserData?.job?.title
(if fetchedUserData exists -> access job, if job exists -> access title)

- use this for nested objects and to not get runtime error

============ Nullish coalescing ============
when we're not sure if data is null/undefined/valid
- checks if some value is null or undefined (not empty string or zero)
-> use ??

const userInput = undefined;
const storedData = userInput ?? 'DEFAULT';
