*experimental feature
(Public and private field declarations are an experimental feature (stage 3) proposed at TC39)
1. public field
class Rectangle {
  height = 0;
  width;
  constructor(height, width) {    
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

2. private field
class Rectangle {
  #height = 0;
  #width;
  constructor(height, width) {    
    this.#height = height;
    this.#width = width;
  }
}
