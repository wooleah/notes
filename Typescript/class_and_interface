*experimental feature
(Public and private field declarations are an experimental feature (stage 3) proposed at TC39)
1. public field
class Rectangle {
  height = 0;
  width;
  constructor(height, width) {    
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

2. private field
class Rectangle {
  #height = 0;
  #width;
  constructor(height, width) {    
    this.#height = height;
    this.#width = width;
  }
}


============ important class tips ============

a. this
you can specify who should call this in a function
describe(this: Department) { -> throws an error when this is not the Department object
  console.log(`Department: ${this.name}`);
}

b. private & public properties
- write private modifier in front of properties and methods
- public is default

c. initializing shorthand
constructor(private id: string, public name: string) {
  this.employees = [] <- private property
}
- you don't need to write this.id = id anymore

d. readonly
add this modifier to properties that shouldn't change after being initialized
- this makes your code really clear


============ inheritance ============
- can only inherit from one class
- private properties are not accessible from inheriting class(you can change private -> protected to allow access from child class)
