===== I will write things that I didn't know =====

1. template element is not rendered initially, you can use js to get and render it
2. document.getElementById -> we don't know which element
3. document.importNode -> gives copy of the element, second param is deepCopy, returns DocumentFragment
4. this.templateEl.content -> ref to the content of the template element
5. this.hostEl.insertAdjacentElement(position, getElementById)
6. importedNode.firstElementChild -> returns the first element child
7. PropertyDescriptor.value on method is method itself
8. Instead of returning something, you can return nothing or throw an error
9. declare var google: any -> tells typescript that this will exist so don't worry
10. to teach ts about other libs -> search for types something(like google maps
11.
