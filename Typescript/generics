============ What is it ============
<T> is generic type
it's used in combination with other types

const names: Array<string> = ['Max', 'Manuel'];
-> generic type can also be union types
by doing this you can use string methods in names[i]

We can also use it with promise(typescript has this type)
const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('This is done'), 1000);
});
set type of promise like future in dart(it's all about what that promise will resolve to)
-> by setting the return type, we can use that functionalities


============ Create generic type (function, classes) ============
function merge(objA: object, objB: object) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}
const mergedObj = merge({ name: 'Woojae' }, { age: 30 });
-> we can't access name or age in mergedObj because typescript doesn't know that this object has those properties

So do this
function merge<T, U>(objA: T, objB: U) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB);
}
-> typescript knows that object.assign returns intersection so merge function will return T & U

- in the previous example, typescript knows that return type will be the intersection of two objects
, but two unknown objects
- with generic types we're telling typescript that those two T and U objects are specific types of objects
- we don't care about the specific object(being restrictive), we're just saying those two objects will be different types
, so typescript you do your work and get intersection for me

You can also do this when you call the function
merge<string, number>() 
or be more specific(kinda redundant) -> typescript will infer the type anyway(so don't do it)
merge<{name:string, hobbies:string[]}, {age:number}>

============ Constraints ============
const mergedObj1 = merge({ name: 'Woojae', hobbies: ['reading books'] }, 30);
console.log(mergedObj1);
-> { name: 'Woojae', hobbies: [ 'reading books' ] } (js failed silently)

to prevent this we can restrict generic types with contraints
-> function merge<T extends object, U extends object>
we're telling typescript that T and U can be any structure of any type but has to be objects
- you can also use union types there

============ built-in (generic) utility types** ============
1. Partial
- let's say that we have this interface
interface CourseGoal {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completeUntil: Date;
}
- but we want to have some validation and set the properties partially
let courseGoal: Partial<CourseGoal> = {}; // this makes properties in CourseGoal optional
- without Partial typescript will throw an error

- Full example
function createCourseGoal(title: string, description: string, date: Date): CourseGoal {
  let courseGoal: Partial<CourseGoal> = {};
  courseGoal.title = title;
  courseGoal.description = description;
  courseGoal.completeUntil = date;
  return courseGoal as CourseGoal; // Change it back to original interface
}

2. ReadOnly
- With this used like below, you can't modify the object(both array and object)
const names: Readonly<string[]> = ['Woojae', 'Aleah'];
names.push('Sam');
names.pop();

============ Generic vs union ============
instead of
class DataStorage<T extends string | number | boolean> {...}
you can do
class DataStorage {
  private data: (string | number | boolean)[] = [];
}
-> It's not the same(it's mixed)
With generic type, you can only use one type once it enters the class instance
