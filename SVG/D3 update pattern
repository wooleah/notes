- enter selection are elements that needs to enter the DOM
- exit selection are elements that are about to exit the DOM
- group selection are elements that are currently showing on the page
-> tells us what's currently on the page, what will enter and what should get removed

D3 update pattern
1. make a function that runs whenever firestore data updates(have to add a listener)

- updates scales(domains) that relies on our data
y.domain([0, d3.max(data, d => d.orders)]) // because max value can change when data changes

- join updated data to our elements // there could be one more or less docs on the new updated data
const rects graph.selectAll('rect').data(data)

- remove unwanted shapes using exit selection
rects.exit().remove();

- update current shapes in the DOM
rects.attr(...)

- append the enter selection to the DOM
rects.enter().append('rect').attr(...)
