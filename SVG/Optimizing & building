Optimizing
1. Reduce the number of points
2. drop shadows are expensive
- remove the drop shadow(png), and add svg filters in illustrator(Ai_shadow)
3. remove one color that's repeated a lot and instead draw a big rectangle with that color behind it(adobe illustrator)
- select color -> same -> fill color

4. optimize tools
- svgomg
- peter collingridge's svg editor
- svgo(svgo-gui)


Starting
When you're making an svg animation
- put all of the things inside the canvas first and then think about starting/end point
- hide everything that's not showing on the starting point first(opacity 0), then think about how you would transition it
- slowly reveal things

*Design everything first, slowly unveil things

draw thing on a piece of paper and try it out
- ugly storyboards save you time!


Prototyping
1. thumbanils - notes for yourself(rough)
2. storyboards - notes for collabs(just high enough fidelity so other people can understand it)
3. low fidelity prototypes - show the motion(after effect?)
- you could do it in code as well
- you need to animate a lot of things to get better at animations
