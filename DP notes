DP helps us solve recursive problems with a highly-overlapping subproblem structure(subproblems repeating again and again)
: When the subproblems don't overlap, the algorithm is divide and conquer.

1. Come up with recursive solution
2. Use memoization(caching calculated data to avoid calculating the same subproblem again)
3. Think of Bottom-up approach

FAST method (solve any dp problem!)
Find the first solution
Analyze the solution
identify the Subproblems
Turn around the solution
