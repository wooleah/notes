Remember that React, Vue, Angular are just tools

jQuery was very imperative, tells the browser exactly what and how to do stuff -> creates lots of inconsistencies
- constantly keeping track of what changed and what to change is a huge mess(hard to scale and manage)

React does one thing(View) really really good
- manages to make our website(DOM) change in predictable ways that is easy to scale and easy to manage.

Think in component point of view
- it works on its own

React has one-way dataflow(data only flows from top -> bottom)
- less bug-prone code
React has virtual DOM(js object that describes the website)
- we want less DOM manipulation because browser has to work really hard
