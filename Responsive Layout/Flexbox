It shrinks to the smallest possible size by default. Also it's children becomes a column


Adding gap between children
1. You could add gap: 100px on flexbox(parent) to add some gaps between its childern, but it's supported in firebox only

2. You can use combinator
.col + .col {
  background-color: limegreen;
}
-> checks if .col element has column before it, and if it does, it gets selected
-> you can add margins!


Don't merge too many properties into one class
ex) container + row(flexbox)
