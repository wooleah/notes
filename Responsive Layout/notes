Day 1: Using percentage & avoiding heights

Problem: Make a set width and then add tons of media queries to make it responsive
-> Fixed width is bad?

By default things are responsive
- when you don't do anything, it's ugly, but responsive
- because width of an element is 100% of viewport(body width) by default
- IF IT'S NOT RESPONSIVE, IT'S YOUR FAULT
- Heights are also bad for the same reason

How does % width work?
- x% of direct parent

Using em & rem
- 1em by default is 16px(relative to font size)
