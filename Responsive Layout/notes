Day 1: Using percentage & avoiding heights

Problem: Make a set width and then add tons of media queries to make it responsive
-> Fixed width is bad?

By default things are responsive
- when you don't do anything, it's ugly, but responsive
- because width of an element is 100% of viewport(body width) by default
- IF IT'S NOT RESPONSIVE, IT'S YOUR FAULT
- Heights are also bad for the same reason

How does % width work?
- x% of direct parent

Using em & rem
- 1em by default is 16px(relative to font size)

- em is relative to the parent(font size) and rem is relative to the root font size(of html)
-> rem is more consistent and easy to predict
- using rem helps when you want to change font-size of your website

When to use em?
using em, you can make your button and text easily adapt to your font-size
- big button with big text will change the button padding size when text gets smaller
Just by using em to size your element, you can easily change the size of whole element by adjusting font-size
- used with rem you can change padding easily by changing rem(font-size)

Try to keep .container class to have width(%), max-width(px), and margin auto to center (minimal as possible)
