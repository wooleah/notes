Day 1: Using percentage & avoiding heights

Problem: Make a set width and then add tons of media queries to make it responsive
-> Fixed width is bad?

By default things are responsive
- when you don't do anything, it's ugly, but responsive
- because width of an element is 100% of viewport(body width) by default
